Abstract:
I present a tool for visualizing algorithms that solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), in a fun, informative and visually pleasing manner. The tool can be used on both personal computers and a tangible user interface machine called reactable. The tool is built in such a way that it can easily be extended to include other algorithms, aside from TSP.
