###Abstract:
I present a tool for visualizing algorithms that solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), in a fun, dynamic and visually pleasing manner. TSP is extended to represent a simplified version of a real world scenario: travelling between a region of cities, where some roads experience traffic jams and constructions. The tool is meant to be used on a tangible user interface machine called reactable. However, the simulation can also be used on personal computers, though less fun. The tool is built in such a way that it can easily be extended to include other algorithms, aside from TSP.
